# Damned Family Reports Book

If you are an azerbaijani, you already know this problem. 

You get asked a lot of questions regarding your employment, salary and other private topics by relatives, and you get to be discussion topic all the time. But you don't want to tell everything and end up telling lies to everyone. 

To keep track of this very problem, I've built "Damned Family Reports Book". 

- Add family members and other relatives
- Create topics and provide answers to them
- Later, as you update your answers, add new entries to later reference to and be consistent through out your lies.

I hate this man..
